# Foundations of Hierarchical / Multilevel / Mixed Effects Models 

Repo contains foundational materials and examples implementing Bayesian and Frequentist Hierarchical models on simulated bounce rate data and a toy dataset.

The toy dataset was implemented and analyzed in Python using two packages `statsmodels` and `pymer4`, while the bounce rate dataset was implemented and analyzed in R using the `lme4` (frequentist) and `brms` (bayesian) packages.

These materials are related to the following Towards Data Science article:
